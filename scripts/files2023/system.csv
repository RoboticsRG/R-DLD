BluePass;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.booncode.bluepass4/index.html;DescriptionBluePass extracts two factor authentication codes 2FA from SMS and sends them to a paired device via Bluetooth RFCOMM A Qt based companion app bluepassserver will receive the 2FA codes and provide them via the system clipboardUse CaseThe company I work for is relying on third party services that require to authenticate using 2FA The second factor is an SMS to your mobile phone This app was built for convenience to avoid having to unlock your phone find the message and then type the received code on the PCIt is not about the time saved its about getting rid of robot tasksSetupYou have to configure parameters to match the sender of the SMS and parse the code from the messages sent to you Currently regular expressions are used for this task However a very basic setup will be provided belowRegular expression for sender has to be set to a regular expression that matches all the senders of SMS as they appear in your chat application Multiple numbers and names can be provided To match CompanyA you might simply putCompanyA into the box To match CompanyA and 12345678 write CompanyA12345678Regular expression to filter the content has to be set to a regular expression that matches the messages you want to catch Additionally it has to define one group to extract the actual code that has to be sent to the PC To match any number you can use \d\d To match a code only with 6 digits use \d6 as the process of defining a proper regular expression is not that easy there is another text box Test message You can paste here the content of the SMS thatyou want to match and adjust the regular expression until it gets parsed correctlyThe last step of the configuration is to pair with the bluetooth adapter of your PC and configure the adapter to be usedOperation Whenever your mobile phone receives an SMS and the settings above are configured this app will try to match the sender and content If one of the two doesnt match the message will not be processed any further If the 2FA code could be extracted a foreground service will be started status bar and the app tries to connect to the configured Bluetooth adapter and sends the code It retries for some amount of time and reports the status in the status bar Note The notification in the status bar doesnt automatically disappear However this doesnt consume any resources and can be removed using the Stop button  If the code is required on the mobile phone it can be copied using the Copy last buttonProtocolThe communication is based on very simple primitives using an RFCOMM channel The UUID for the service is e4d56fb3b86d45729b0d44d483eb1eee Extracted codes are sent as text over a secure Bluetooth connection terminated with a new line character Therefore codes may not contain any new line charactersFuture The protocol will be changed to something more sophisticated and extensible Configuration of the sender should be done through contact providers and not use regular expressions Allow to use this app to share text  files with the PC;https://f-droid.org/repo/org.booncode.bluepass4_5.apk;This version requires Android 10 or newer.;https://github.com/boon-code/bluepass;https://github.com/boon-code/bluepass/issues;0.3.0;access approximate location only in the foreground <-> access precise location only in the foreground <-> pair with Bluetooth devices <-> access Bluetooth settings <-> connect to paired Bluetooth devices <-> discover and pair nearby Bluetooth devices <-> run foreground service <-> receive text messages (SMS) <-> prevent phone from sleeping <->
