No Thanks!;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.veldsoft.no.thanks/index.html;No Thanks is a card game created by Thorsten Gimmler ideal for groups of three to seven players Originally known as Geschenkt it was first published by Amigo Spiele in 2004 and later translated into English by ZMan GamesCard Range The game features playing cards numbered from 3 to 35 Before the game begins nine cards are randomly selected and removed from the deck which is then thoroughly shuffledChips Distribution The number of chips each player receives at the start of the game depends on the player count With 3 to 5 players each player begins with 11 chips For 6 players each starts with 9 chips and in games with 7 players each player receives 7 chips Players also have the option to conceal their chips from others if they wishGame Initiation The first player initiates the game by revealing the top card from the shuffled deck They have a choice they can either take the card accumulating points according to its value or opt to pass on it by paying a chip which is then placed on the card The player must declare No thanks when passing Subsequently play continues in a clockwise direction with each player making the same decision when their turn arrivesCollecting Cards and Chips The gameplay continues until a player decides to take the card along with all the chips accumulated on it if any The player who accepts the card then flips over the next card and repeats the process deciding whether to take it or pass it This pattern persists until all the cards in the deck have been takenScoring In the final scoring phase of the game players calculate their points based on the values of the cards they have collected Notably cards in a consecutive run are treated as a single card with the lowest value For example a run of cards with numbers 30 29 28 and 27 would be considered a 27point set Each chip held by a player incurs a negative point resulting in a strategic consideration to minimize the number of chips you accumulateVictory The player or players with the lowest overall point total win the game Mastering the art of minimizing card values and judicious chip management are key strategies for success in No Thanks;https://f-droid.org/repo/eu.veldsoft.no.thanks_1.apk;This version requires Android 13 or newer.;https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/No-Thanks-for-Android;https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/No-Thanks-for-Android/issues;1.00;eu.veldsoft.no.thanks.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION <->
