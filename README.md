# R-DLD: Robotic-supported Data Loss Detection
Automatically Revealing Data Loss Bugs in Android Apps using a robot.

## Prerequisites
[Data Loss Detector](DataLossDetector.md)

## How to use the tool
Added a -robot parameter to enable rotation functionality using a robot.

## Install
To install R-DLD follow these steps:
* git clone https://github.com/replication-papers/R-DLD.git
* cd cd R-DLD/application/R-DLD-Arduino/
* virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
* source venv/bin/activate
* cd droidbot-tool
* pip install -e .
* cd ..
* pip install -e .
### Exemple
A running instance can be located in the application directory. If needed, modify the run.sh file to execute it without the --robot parameter.
* cd application/
* ./run.sh
## Permissions
Linux permissions to access the Arduino board.
* chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
