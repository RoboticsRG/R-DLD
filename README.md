# R-DLD: Robotic-supported Data Loss Detection
Automatically Revealing Data Loss Bugs in Android Apps using a robot.

## Prerequisites
[Data Loss Detector](DataLossDetector.md)

## How to use the tool
Added a -robot parameter to enable rotation functionality using a robot.

## Install
* git clone https://github.com/replication-papers/R-DLD.git
* cd R-DLD
* virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
* source venv/bin/activate
* cd DLD-tool
* cd droidbot-tool
* pip install -e .
* cd ..
* pip install -e .
