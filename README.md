## Build Robot
[Robot parts](build%20robot/README.MD)


## Architecture
[Architecture](application/README.md)


## Install
To install R-DLD follow these steps:
* git clone https://github.com/replication-papers/R-DLD.git
* cd cd R-DLD/application/R-DLD-Arduino/
* virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
* source venv/bin/activate
* cd droidbot-tool
* pip install -e .
* cd ..
* pip install -e .
### Exemple
A running instance can be located in the application directory. If needed, modify the run.sh file to execute it without the --robot parameter.
* cd application/
* ./run.sh


### How to use the tool
R-DLD works via command line and requires only the apk file of the app to be tested. It is not necessary to be inside the R-DLD folder to start the tool. It is possible to set the execution time in terms of either time in seconds or number of events to be generated. 
1) Make sure you have an Android device opened and connected via ADB (check it out by typing **adb devices**)
2) Launch R-DLD by typing **dld -a <appname.apk> -o <output_folder>**. This is the most basic command to start R-DLD using the default settings. 
It is possible to add one or more customized settings:
   - **-robot**: parameter to enable rotation functionality using a robot
   - **-is_emulator**: add this option if you are using an Android Virtual Device
   - **-scroll_full_down_y \<number\>**: the y coordinate on the screen from which R-DLD starts to swipe up (1600 by default)
   - **-main_activity <activity_name>**: the activity used by R-DLD to start the app. Sometimes, R-DLD fails to get the correct main activity from the manifest.xml of the app. For example, in the "Bee Count" app, it uses *com.knirirr.beecount..WelcomeActivity* (with two dots) instead of *com.knirirr.beecount.WelcomeActivity* (with one dot).
As a result, R-DLD will not be able to start the app. If this happens, specify the correct main activity with the **-main_activity** option. For example, *-main_activity com.knirirr.beecount.WelcomeActivity*
   - **-epsilon \<number\>**: a value between 0.0 to 1.0 (0.1 by default). 0.0 implies a pure systematic exploration while 1.0 
   implies a pure random exploration
   - **-timeout \<number\>**: the time in seconds to be allocated for the execution
   - **-count \<number\>**: the number of events to be generated (2250 by default)
   - **-interval \<number\>**: the sleep time among the events (3 seconds by default). Increase this value if your Android device works slowly
   - **-script <your_script.json>**: specify the json script to force R-DLD to execute specific actions. It is useful if the app requires, for example, a login
   - **-grant_perm**: it grants all the permissions the app requires (recommanded)
   - **-keep_app**: it does not uninstall the app after the execution of R-DLD
   - type **dld --help** or **dld -h** for more details
